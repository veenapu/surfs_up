# Surf's Up Challenge
## Module 9: Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to gather more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop in Oahu. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Resources: 
Data Source:  SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb, hawaii.sqlite
Software/Programs: Python, Pandas functions and methods, SQLalchemy, Jupyter Notebook

This assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

### Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database and write a query to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. 
- The temperatures are added to a list.
- The list of temperatures is converted to a Pandas DataFrame.
- Generate the summary statistics for the dataframe for the month of June.
